## Key Points
In this lesson, students will take a coding challenge. The assessment is being used to get a sense of student mastery and see what they are able to code independently. This data can be used to inform instruction within your program and is used at a national level to get a grasp of student mastery, and make adjustments to the curriculum as needed.


- ⏰ Do Now (2) : 
    -  Students should open up the reference table and the W3Schools to get ready for the challenge. <br><br>

- 🎯 Challenge Overview (5) :
    - Explain what the challenge will look like, and what resources students will be able to use to complete the challenge. Do not spend over 5 minutes on this section if you have a particularly short class (40 minutes or less). <br><br>

- 👾 Coding Challenge (20-30) : 
    - Students will take the coding challenge. Make sure to circulate around the room to be able to support students as needed. For the open-ended question, make sure students complete all of the tasks.  <br><br>


## Notes
Google Forms autosave responses IF users have signed in and entered their email address. Students who are absent the day of the challenge should take it either after school, during office hours, or during the next class. They can also schedule a specific time to do it online with their Program Manager.
