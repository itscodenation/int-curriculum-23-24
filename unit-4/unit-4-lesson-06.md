## Common Misconceptions
- Misunderstanding the .value Property: Students might think that .value can be used with any HTML element. It's crucial to clarify that .value is specifically used with form elements like input, select, and textarea.

- Confusing Value with Text: There can be confusion between the text displayed in an input field and its value attribute. Students should understand that .value returns the current text in the input field, not the value of the value attribute in the HTML.

- Variable Scope Misconception: In JavaScript, understanding variable scope can be challenging. Ensure students know where a variable should be declared and how it can be accessed, especially in the context of event handling.

- Event Handling Confusion: Students might struggle with the concept of event handling and how it triggers the retrieval of input values. They may not immediately grasp how events like clicking a button can be linked to executing JavaScript code.

- DOM Manipulation Complexity: The concept of manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) to display values might be confusing. Students might not initially see the connection between the JavaScript code and the changes in the webpage.
