## Key Points
This lesson covers class attributes which enable grouping and distinct styling of specific HTML elements. They overcome uniform styling limitations and increase CSS specificity. By assigning classes, you can target elements individually for unique design.

    -  Display the "Do Now" challenge: How to make only the "Apples" h2 element red while keeping the other h2 elements green.
    -  Allow students a few minutes to think and share their ideas with a partner or in a class discussion.
    -  Discuss the challenge as a class, encouraging students to share their solutions and thought process.
    -  Review the Spicy Task solution and address any questions or clarifications.<br><br>

        - Choose which HTML tags to style differently.
        - Assign meaningful class names to those tags.

- 💻 Code Along (5) :
    - Open the code-along.html file and share your screen.
    - Guide students step-by-step through completing tasks, explaining your thought process and providing opportunities for questions.<br><br>

- 💻 Code it Solo  (15): 
    - Instruct students to open the code-solo.html file on their own computers.
    - Assign tasks and encourage them to work independently.
    - Remind them to refer to the earlier code along if they encounter difficulties. <br><br>

- 👋 Exit Ticket & Closing (5)
    - Instruct students to go to Google Classroom for the Exit Ticket related to the lesson.
