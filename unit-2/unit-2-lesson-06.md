## Common Misconceptions

1. **Box Model Confusion:**
   * **Misconception:** Padding, border, and margin are often interchangeable or confused with one another.
   * **Clarification:** Padding creates space within the element, between the content and the border; the border is a visible line that goes around the padding and content; and margin creates space outside the border, between elements.

2. **Understanding Flexbox:**
   * **Misconception:** The concept of flex containers and flex items can be confusing, leading to incorrect assumptions about how items will be arranged.
   * **Clarification:** The container's properties affect the layout of the items inside, and understanding parent-child relationships is essential to properly using Flexbox.
